            "content": "A 30-year-old man will be charged in court on Mar. 14 for allegedly causing public nuisance and using threatening behaviour against a public service worker at Changi Airport. According to the Singapore Police Force (SPF), they were alerted to a dispute at Changi Airport on Jan. 31 at around 2:10pm involving a private hire driver and an airport shuttle bus driver. The man was allegedly upset at the shuttle service driver for changing lanes. He then tailgated the bus and used his car to block the shuttle bus. The man proceeded to exit his car and began gesticulating and shouting vulgarities at the shuttle bus driver. When the shuttle bus driver tried to drive away, the man allegedly kicked the shuttle bus's door and threw his mobile phone at it \"in an aggressive manner\". He was subsequently arrested by the police at the scene. If found guilty of committing public nuisance, the man could be sentenced to up to three months in jail, a fine of up to S$2,000, or both. For using threatening behaviour against a public service worker, the man could face a jail term of up to 12 months, a fine of S$5,000, or both. \"The police take a serious view of any form of harassment or threatening behaviours toward public service workers including those providing transport services for the public,\" said SPF. \"Such acts not only disrupt essential services but also cause unnecessary inconvenience to the members of the public.\" _Top photos via Changi Airport/Facebook_",
