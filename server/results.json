            "content": "SINGAPORE \u2013 New citizens bring with them something extra that is vital to Singapore, enriching its society and invigorating its economy, said Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong on March 9.\n\n\u201cNew arrivals bring fresh experiences, diverse perspectives and global connections. You help us to plug into the world, and thrive as a regional hub and a global node,\u201d said SM Lee.\n\nThis was how cities like London, New York and Shanghai became great centres of culture and prosperity \u2013 by attracting talent from all over the world and creating an environment of constant innovation and enterprise, he added.\n\nThis dynamism spurs growth and reinforces the success of these cities, and attracts even more talent, said SM Lee, who was speaking at the Teck Ghee Citizenship Ceremony held at Nanyang Polytechnic.\n\n\u201cSingapore, too, must always be open to ideas and talent from around the world,\u201d he told about 200 new citizens. \u201cThis is how we became a shining red dot.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that immigration is essential \u2013 even existential \u2013 for Singapore\u2019s survival.\n\nWhile larger nations may have the population, resources and hinterland to fall back on, Singapore does not. Singaporeans are not having enough children of their own, and the resident workforce is already at full employment, and ageing, he said.\n\nSingapore needs new citizens to top up its numbers and to keep its economy growing, he said.\n\nImmigration will bring more competition and put pressure on Singaporeans to work harder and meet higher standards, but this will create a more vibrant economy and generate better opportunities and brighter prospects for future generations, he added.\n\n\u201cIf Singapore closes ourselves up, opportunities will pass us by. We will fall behind, and become just like any other city in the region, and our descendants will be the worse off for it,\u201d said SM Lee.\n\nEvery year, the Republic has about 30,000 citizen babies born and takes in about 22,000 new citizens.\n\nGiven that the inflows are not small, the Government is keenly aware of the need to handle immigration and integration sensitively, said SM Lee.\n\nHe noted that immigration is a sensitive issue in every country, and there is always some tension between newcomers and those who are already here.\n\nGovernments play a big part in managing these tensions to make immigration a net plus for societies, SM Lee said.\n\nUnfortunately, this does not always happen, he noted.\n\nIn many European countries, the immigration inflows have triggered a strong nativist pushback. And when immigrants commit violent crimes, that further turns the mood against them, and deepens divisions in society.\n\nIt is therefore crucial that Singapore manages its immigration inflow carefully: keeping it measured and balanced, paying close attention to relations and harmony between different ethnic groups, between new arrivals and people who are here, and taking in people who can fit in and add to Singapore\u2019s society, SM Lee said.\n\nIn Singapore, every new citizen goes through the Singapore Citizenship Journey on what it means to be Singaporean before getting citizenship. Integration and Naturalisation Champions from the People\u2019s Association also run many programmes to welcome and integrate new citizens into their communities.\n\nSM Lee urged the new citizens to play their part by learning Singapore\u2019s values and cultural norms, as well as getting involved and contributing actively to their communities.\n\nOther Singaporeans must play their part too by making friends with the new arrivals, and be big-hearted in welcoming them as valuable members of the Singapore team, he said.\n\nThey should firmly reject those who play up nativist and xenophobic sentiments for political gain, which will do great harm to Singapore\u2019s society, he added.\n\nThe new citizens received their citizenship certificates from SM Lee, recited the National Pledge and sang the National Anthem to reinforce their commitment to Singapore and their shared identity as Singaporeans.\n\nAmong the new citizens was Ms Prithikka Divyashini, 19, who moved to Singapore from Johor Bahru, Malaysia, about 12 years ago.\n\nThe second-year chemical process technology student at ITE College East is the president of her school\u2019s student ambassadors, and an active volunteer with local charity Meals on Wheels, distributing food to the elderly monthly.\n\nHer father is a Singaporean, and two of her three older siblings had received their Singapore citizenship before her. Her mother and sister are Singapore permanent residents (PRs).\n\nDr Pham The Hanh, 46, came to Singapore from Hanoi, Vietnam, in 2003 on a Ministry of Education scholarship to do his PhD in electronics and computer engineering at the National University of Singapore.\n\nHe stayed on as a researcher, and has been an engineering lecturer at Ngee Ann Polytechnic for over a decade. He has also been giving free tuition to primary and secondary school children at Teck Ghee Community Club once a week for more than five years.\n\n\u201cI was back in Hanoi and felt that I missed my char kway teow,\u201d he said. \u201cBut mainly, it was the kindness and warmth of my colleagues and friends in Singapore that made me decide to be a Singaporean.\u201d\n\nWith him was his 16-year-old son, Pham Cao Hai Phong, a Deyi secondary 4 student, who also received his citizenship at the event.\n\nDr Pham\u2019s wife is a Singapore PR, and his 10-year-old daughter became a Singaporean earlier.\n\n\u201cIt was easy for me to adapt to life here as I like the weather, food and people,\u201d he said. \u201cI will give back to Singapore by helping to educate young Singaporeans.",

You help us to plug into the world, and thrive as a regional hub and a global node,\u201d said SM Lee. This was how cities like London, New York and Shanghai became great centres of culture and prosperity \u2013 by attracting talent from all over the world and creating an environment of constant innovation and enterprise, he added. This dynamism spurs growth and reinforces the success of these cities, and attracts even more talent, said SM Lee, who was speaking at the Teck Ghee Citizenship Ceremony held at Nanyang Polytechnic. \u201cSingapore, too, must always be open to ideas and talent from around the world,\u201d he told about 200 new citizens. \u201cThis is how we became a shining red dot.\u201d He pointed out that immigration is essential \u2013 even existential \u2013 for Singapore\u2019s survival. While larger nations may have the population, resources and hinterland to fall back on, Singapore does not. Singaporeans are not having enough children of their own, and the resident workforce is already at full employment, and ageing, he said. Singapore needs new citizens to top up its numbers and to keep its economy growing, he said. Immigration will bring more competition and put pressure on Singaporeans to work harder and meet higher standards, but this will create a more vibrant economy and generate better opportunities and brighter prospects for future generations, he added. \u201cIf Singapore closes ourselves up, opportunities will pass us by. We will fall behind, and become just like any other city in the region, and our descendants will be the worse off for it,\u201d said SM Lee. Every year, the Republic has about 30,000 citizen babies born and takes in about 22,000 new citizens. Given that the inflows are not small, the Government is keenly aware of the need to handle immigration and integration sensitively, said SM Lee. He noted that immigration is a sensitive issue in every country, and there is always some tension between newcomers and those who are already here. Governments play a big part in managing these tensions to make immigration a net plus for societies, SM Lee said. Unfortunately, this does not always happen, he noted. In many European countries, the immigration inflows have triggered a strong nativist pushback. And when immigrants commit violent crimes, that further turns the mood against them, and deepens divisions in society. It is therefore crucial that Singapore manages its immigration inflow carefully: keeping it measured and balanced, paying close attention to relations and harmony between different ethnic groups, between new arrivals and people who are here, and taking in people who can fit in and add to Singapore\u2019s society, SM Lee said. In Singapore, every new citizen goes through the Singapore Citizenship Journey on what it means to be Singaporean before getting citizenship. Integration and Naturalisation Champions from the People\u2019s Association also run many programmes to welcome and integrate new citizens into their communities. SM Lee urged the new citizens to play their part by learning Singapore\u2019s values and cultural norms, as well as getting involved and contributing actively to their communities. Other Singaporeans must play their part too by making friends with the new arrivals, and be big-hearted in welcoming them as valuable members of the Singapore team, he said. They should firmly reject those who play up nativist and xenophobic sentiments for political gain, which will do great harm to Singapore\u2019s society, he added. The new citizens received their citizenship certificates from SM Lee, recited the National Pledge and sang the National Anthem to reinforce their commitment to Singapore and their shared identity as Singaporeans. Among the new citizens was Ms Prithikka Divyashini, 19, who moved to Singapore from Johor Bahru, Malaysia, about 12 years ago.

This was how cities like London, New York and Shanghai became great centres of culture and prosperity \u2013 by attracting talent from all over the world and creating an environment of constant innovation and enterprise, he added. This dynamism spurs growth and reinforces the success of these cities, and attracts even more talent, said SM Lee, who was speaking at the Teck Ghee Citizenship Ceremony held at Nanyang Polytechnic. \u201cSingapore, too, must always be open to ideas and talent from around the world,\u201d he told about 200 new citizens. \u201cThis is how we became a shining red dot.\u201d He pointed out that immigration is essential \u2013 even existential \u2013 for Singapore\u2019s survival. While larger nations may have the population, resources and hinterland to fall back on, Singapore does not. Singaporeans are not having enough children of their own, and the resident workforce is already at full employment, and ageing, he said. Singapore needs new citizens to top up its numbers and to keep its economy growing, he said. Immigration will bring more competition and put pressure on Singaporeans to work harder and meet higher standards, but this will create a more vibrant economy and generate better opportunities and brighter prospects for future generations, he added. \u201cIf Singapore closes ourselves up, opportunities will pass us by. We will fall behind, and become just like any other city in the region, and our descendants will be the worse off for it,\u201d said SM Lee. Every year, the Republic has about 30,000 citizen babies born and takes in about 22,000 new citizens. Given that the inflows are not small, the Government is keenly aware of the need to handle immigration and integration sensitively, said SM Lee. He noted that immigration is a sensitive issue in every country, and there is always some tension between newcomers and those who are already here. Governments play a big part in managing these tensions to make immigration a net plus for societies, SM Lee said. Unfortunately, this does not always happen, he noted. In many European countries, the immigration inflows have triggered a strong nativist pushback. And when immigrants commit violent crimes, that further turns the mood against them, and deepens divisions in society. It is therefore crucial that Singapore manages its immigration inflow carefully: keeping it measured and balanced, paying close attention to relations and harmony between different ethnic groups, between new arrivals and people who are here, and taking in people who can fit in and add to Singapore\u2019s society, SM Lee said. In Singapore, every new citizen goes through the Singapore Citizenship Journey on what it means to be Singaporean before getting citizenship. Integration and Naturalisation Champions from the People\u2019s Association also run many programmes to welcome and integrate new citizens into their communities. SM Lee urged the new citizens to play their part by learning Singapore\u2019s values and cultural norms, as well as getting involved and contributing actively to their communities. Other Singaporeans must play their part too by making friends with the new arrivals, and be big-hearted in welcoming them as valuable members of the Singapore team, he said. They should firmly reject those who play up nativist and xenophobic sentiments for political gain, which will do great harm to Singapore\u2019s society, he added. The new citizens received their citizenship certificates from SM Lee, recited the National Pledge and sang the National Anthem to reinforce their commitment to Singapore and their shared identity as Singaporeans.
