Convicted in 2010 and given the mandatory death penalty, his appeals and petition for clemency were rejected.\n\nHis execution, the third for drug-related offences in Singapore this month and the eighth this year, has drawn attention from international human rights groups.\n\nRavina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), [urged](https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2024/11/21/un-human-rights-office-urges-singapore-to-halt-execution-of-death-row-inmate-with-intellectual-disabilities/) the Singapore Government to commute his sentence to imprisonment, criticising the use of capital punishment for drug-related offences as incompatible with international human rights law.\n\nShamdasani pointed to growing evidence that the death penalty is ineffective as a deterrent, calling on Singapore to align with the global shift toward abolition.\n\nOHCHR experts reiterated that the death penalty for drug trafficking violates international law, urging Singapore to adopt a human rights-based approach to address drug issues.\n\nThe execution invites a critical rethinking of Singapore\u2019s death penalty: does it genuinely deter drug offences, act as a symbolic statement of state authority, or reflect blind faith in a failing policy?\n\n### Deterrence: A belief unproven\n\nThe deterrent effect of the death penalty is a cornerstone of Singapore\u2019s anti-drug stance. The government frequently cites public surveys to bolster its position, with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) reporting that 87.9% of respondents in 2023 believed the death penalty deters significant drug trafficking.\n\nHowever, recent statistics raise questions about this claim. According to the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB), drug abuser arrests [increased by 10%](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cnb-drug-report-2023-statistics-3101-abusers-arrested-4122101) in 2023, with over a quarter of those arrested under 30 years old. First-time offenders [rose by 18%](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/young-drug-abusers-singapore-youths-mental-health-family-relationships-stress-4144626), while cannabis users saw [a 17% increase,](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/worrying-increase-in-young-female-abusers-arrested-in-2023-cnb) marking a decade high.\n\nThe steady rise in drug abuser arrests suggests a consistent supply of drugs continues to enter Singapore, despite harsh penalties for traffickers. This raises a critical question: if the death penalty effectively deters trafficking, why does the drug supply persist?\n\nFor many traffickers, particularly those facing economic hardship, the lure of financial security or survival may outweigh the perceived risks of punishment. This challenges the assumption that the death penalty is a universally effective deterrent and calls into question whether punitive measures alone can address the root causes of the drug trade.\n\n### Enforcement or demand?\n\nGovernment agencies often cite increased enforcement as the reason for rising drug arrests, arguing that tougher operations uncover more cases rather than reflecting a failure of the death penalty as a deterrent.\n\nHowever, Singapore\u2019s unique context complicates this explanation. As a water-locked country with strict border controls, the persistence of drug trafficking raises fundamental questions about internal demand. Without significant demand, suppliers would have little incentive to risk smuggling drugs into Singapore, no matter how stringent enforcement measures may be.\n\nThe increase in arrests among younger individuals, including first-time offenders, further suggests a growing appetite for illicit substances. This trend challenges the narrative that the death penalty alone is sufficient to deter drug-related activities. Instead, it points to deeper societal and structural issues that punitive measures fail to address.\n\nThis disconnect between strict penalties and the continued availability of drugs highlights the need to examine other factors, such as enforcement strategies and the drivers of internal demand.\n\n### The human element: exploitation and desperation\n\nA [recent CNN interview](https://amp-cnn-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/10/19/asia/singapore-changi-prison-drugs-war-intl-hnk-dst) with Matthew, a former drug offender in Singapore, sheds light on the thought process of criminals.\n\nDespite knowing the severe penalties, Matthew admitted the threat of execution did not influence his actions. \u201cAt that point in time, I wasn\u2019t thinking about it. In fact, I was actively avoiding the whole issue of consequences,\u201d he said.\n\nMatthew\u2019s story reflects a broader reality: offenders are often driven by desperation or exploited by promises of quick money. Many are misled into believing they are merely transporting harmless items, such as [gold bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheong_Chun_Yin). For individuals struggling to survive or seeking a way out of poverty, such offers can be irresistible.\n\nEven those not in dire straits may fall prey to greed or naivety. Singaporeans frequently fall victim to scams despite public awareness campaigns. If people are so easily deceived in everyday circumstances, it is unsurprising that some are similarly drawn into drug-related crimes, oblivious to the consequences.\n\n### A state statement or blind faith?\n\nSingapore\u2019s insistence on the death penalty appears rooted in its desire to assert a firm stance against drugs.\n\nThe government cites surveys showing strong public support, with 86.6% of respondents in 2023 backing the mandatory death penalty for serious drug offences. [In response](https://www.mha.gov.sg/mediaroom/speeches/response-to-cnn-feature-on-singapore-drug-control-regime) to CNN\u2019s quotes from Matthew, the government pointed to surveys indicating that in regions where many of Singapore\u2019s drug traffickers originate, the majority of the public believes that the death penalty deters drug trafficking.\n\nHowever, it is reasonable to assume that such overwhelming support is shaped by a state-driven narrative that emphasises the necessity of capital punishment while limiting dissenting perspectives.\n\nIt also raises questions about the validity of asking the general public whether penalties deter criminals, as they do not face the circumstances or decisions of those involved in such activities. This is akin to asking individuals whether they would consume drugs when they have no intention of doing so, which fails to reflect the mindset or circumstances of those directly involved in drug offences.\n\nFurther limiting dissent, advocacy groups such as the Transformative Justice Collective (TJC) are legally required under the Public Order and Falsehoods Correction Act (POFMA) to label their statements as falsehoods by publishing correction notices directed by the minister, regardless of context or intent. This effectively forces groups like TJC to concede their views are \u201cincorrect\u201d by government standards, suppressing alternative perspectives and reinforcing the state\u2019s position.\n\nThis dynamic stifles open debate and places significant pressure on dissenting voices to conform. Rather than addressing the substance of criticisms, the government enforces compliance, further entrenching the narrative that the death penalty is indispensable.\n\nSuch actions suggest that maintaining public confidence in the death penalty takes precedence over fostering genuine dialogue. This raises a crucial question: does Singapore\u2019s reliance on capital punishment arise from evidence-based reasoning, or blind faith in its effectiveness?\n\n### Contrasting approaches to drug crime and results\n\n[Drug-related trends in Hong Kong](https://www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?scode=400&pcode=FA100030) have fluctuated, driven by societal factors such as drug availability, economic shifts, and enforcement strategies rather than the absence of capital punishment. This underscores the point that the death penalty is not the definitive factor in shaping drug crime rates. Instead, broader societal and economic dynamics often play a more significant role.\n\nWhen confronted with Hong Kong as a counterexample, Singapore\u2019s government has argued that the two cities\u2019 circumstances differ significantly.\n\nIn [an interview with CNN](https://www.mha.gov.sg/mediaroom/speeches/transcript-of-cnn-interview-with-mr-k-shanmugam-minister-for-home-affairs-and-minister-for-law-on-7-november-2024/), Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs and Law, pointed out that Hong Kong shares a land border with China, which retains the death penalty for drug trafficking.\n\nHe argued that China\u2019s strict enforcement system might explain Hong Kong\u2019s relatively low drug crime rates. In contrast, Singapore lies at the doorstep of the Golden Triangle, one of the world\u2019s largest drug production regions.\n\nHe pointed out that the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has labelled the region as \u201cliterally swimming in drugs,\u201d and yet Singapore is arresting fewer people.\n\n\u201cSo you know, we are, I think, unique amongst many countries in actually having a handle on the problem,\u201d the minister said.\n\nWhile the minister emphasised Singapore\u2019s success in controlling drug trafficking, when asked about how drug arrests went up by 10% last year in Singapore, he also acknowledged significant challenges, including rising arrests and the persistent availability of drugs.\n\n\u201cI think I said it\u2019s a fight that you never say you\u2019ve won. It\u2019s a continuous fight. It\u2019s a continuous work-in-progress. Money, our people can afford it. Two, availability. There are a lot of ways to come in. And now there are other methods, couriers, international parcels, and so on. Three, to a large extent, from your earlier questions, a more permissive environment, a drug culture that\u2019s glamorised in films, in media.\n\nSo we have all of that, and we are actually fighting a very tough battle.\u201d\n\nThe juxtaposition of statements\u2014one highlighting Singapore\u2019s supposed success in controlling drugs and the other conceding rising arrests and the ongoing challenges\u2014reveals a disconnect. The minister\u2019s responses, while addressing the questions, appear to lack coherence, raising concerns about whether the government\u2019s narrative on deterrence and enforcement is grounded in consistency or shaped for convenience.\n\n### A policy under scrutiny\n\nDespite these arguments, the death penalty in Singapore persists less as a proven deterrent and more as a statement of the state\u2019s commitment to combating drugs.\n\nThis arguably enables the government to deflect blame for rising drug problems, framing them as individual failures rather than addressing policy shortcomings, such as providing better mental health support, managing addiction, or focusing less on the incarceration of offenders.\n\nUltimately, Singapore\u2019s reliance on the death penalty may reflect more than a firm anti-drug stance. It could signal blind faith in a policy that increasingly appears ineffective.\n\nThe government\u2019s reliance on public surveys instead of empirical studies raises questions about whether the death penalty\u2019s deterrent effect is supported by robust evidence or shaped by perceptions promoted by state narratives.\n\nI would personally adopt the belief that the death penalty in Singapore functions as a symbol of the state\u2019s resolve\u2014a grim statement that, despite its apparent shortcomings, the government believes it has done its part in the fight against drugs.",
