And when immigrants commit violent crimes, that further turns the mood against them, and deepens divisions in society.<br><br>It is therefore crucial that Singapore manages its immigration inflow carefully: keeping it measured and balanced, paying close attention to relations and harmony between different ethnic groups, between new arrivals\u00a0and people who are here, and taking in people who can fit in and add to Singapore\u2019s society, SM Lee said.<br><br>In Singapore, every new citizen goes through the <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/singaporeans-to-get-to-shape-curriculum-new-citizens-undergo-before-getting-their-ics\">Singapore Citizenship Journey</a> on what it means to be Singaporean before getting citizenship. <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-immigrants-and-citizens-get-into-the-beat-with-singaporeans-to-build-trust-and\">Integration and Naturalisation Champions</a> from the People\u2019s Association also run many programmes to welcome and integrate new citizens into their communities.<br><br>SM Lee urged the new citizens to play their part by learning Singapore\u2019s values and cultural norms, as well as getting involved and contributing actively to their communities<br><br>Other Singaporeans must play their part too by making friends with the new arrivals, and be big-hearted in welcoming them as valuable members of the Singapore team, he said.<br><br>They should firmly reject those who play up nativist and xenophobic sentiments for political gain, which will do great harm to Singapore\u2019s society, he added.<br><br>The new citizens received their citizenship certificates from SM Lee, recited the National Pledge and sang the National Anthem to reinforce their commitment to Singapore and their shared identity as Singaporeans.<br><br>Among the new citizens was Ms Prithikka Divyashini, 19, who moved to Singapore from Johor Bahru, Malaysia, about 12 years ago.<br><br>The second-year chemical process technology student at ITE College East is the president of her school\u2019s student ambassadors, and an active volunteer with local charity Meals on Wheels, distributing food to the elderly monthly.<br><br>Her father is a Singaporean, and two of her three older siblings had received their Singapore citizenship before her.
