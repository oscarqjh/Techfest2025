Dialogue sessions and industry advisories were rolled out in partnership with the SCDF, the Ministry of Manpower and the Waste Management and Recycling Association of Singapore, said NEA.\n\nSCDF said it also conducts inspections, both scheduled and ad hoc from tip-offs by the public, to check for fire hazards.\n\nErrant firms may be issued written warnings to correct fire hazards by a fixed deadline, known as a fire hazard abatement notice, or a notice of offence for \u201cvery serious\u201d cases of non-compliance, said SCDF.\n\nThose slapped with a notice of offence may face up to $5,000 in composition fines after rectifying the hazard or be prosecuted if they fail to do so.\n\nOf the 12 citations issued by SCDF in 2024, six were fire hazard abatement notices and six notices of offence.\n\nIn 2023, it gave out 27 fire hazard abatement notices and 24 notices of offence.\n\nA spokesman for fire prevention specialist firm Linkgas told ST: \u201cThe nature of stored waste \u2013 ranging from paper and plastics to hazardous chemicals \u2013 makes these facilities susceptible to fire outbreaks.\u201d\n\nThese fires can be \u201cdeep-seated\u201d, which means they burn beneath the rubble, he said, making them difficult to reach and more time-consuming to extinguish.",
