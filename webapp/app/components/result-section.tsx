This is an incorrect statement. As soon as Singapore became independent, it joined the United Nations. Speaking to the UN General Assembly on Sept 21, 1965, then Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam explained that Singapore supports the UN Charter because “we realise that the well-being, the security and integrity of my country can be assured only on the basis of these principles. It is practical self-interest and not vague idealism which makes it necessary to give loyal support to these essential elements in the UN Charter”. For the past 60 years, the prime ministers and foreign ministers of Singapore have echoed the view expressed by Mr Rajaratnam in 1965. To Singapore, the UN is an “intrinsic reality”.
